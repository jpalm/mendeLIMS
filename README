== MendeLIMS: a Web-based system for NGS DNA sequencing analysis of clinical populations

MendeLIMS is a laboratory information management system (LIMS) that is adaptable to continuously
evolving experimental protocols and sequencing technologies.  Large clinical genomics studies 
require the ability to select from a large population of patients/samples to identify the samples
of interest.  Samples must be accurately tracked through various transformations in order to be
certain that DNA sequencing results are attributable to the correct originating sample.  This 
web-based LIMS has a flexible configuration, is easily implemented with open source tools and can
be tooled for large scale management of next generation DNA sequencing platforms.

MendeLIMS functionality with respect to genetic studies, can be grouped into four major categories:
(1) enrollment of patients and acquisition of clinical samples,
(2) sample assessment and processing, 
(3) genomic analysis through preparation of next generation DNA sequencing libraries or other molecular
 assays such as microarrays and finally 
(4) DNA sequencing of samples.  

Sequencing steps are designed around Illumina NGS systems that are the most prevalent sequencers,
but the system can easily be configured for any type of NGS instrument.

== Availability:  
A publicly available demonstration version of the application is maintained for evaluation purposes at
http://mendelims.stanford.edu.  To access all functionality of the application as a admin user, use the
login: admin, with password: demo.  MendeLIMS is programmed in Ruby on Rails (RoR) with MySQL database,
and software is freely available for non-commercial use.  Software may be downloaded via SSH at 
git://github.com/sgtc-stanford/mendeLIMS.git, or via git at: git@github.com:sgtc-stanford/mendeLIMS.git
